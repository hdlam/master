This report contains an overview of swarming, Boids and the ChIRP robot. It will explain how the pre-master project uses these ChIRP robots to demonstrate platooning by using a centralized controller with a camera to track the robots. It will also give an idea on how to implement Boids behavior on the ChIRP robot and which problems might occur, and how to fix these.
