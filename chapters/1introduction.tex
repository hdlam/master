\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
My project description was supposed to be evolutionary algorithms and/or artificial neural network on adaptive robots, on either complex robots with the Department of Engineering Cybernetics or using the ChIRP robots developed at the crab lab (Department of Engineering Cybernetics). The crab lab is a part of the artificial intelligence at the Department of Computer and Information Science at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology\footnote{\href{http://crab.idi.ntnu.no/index.php}{http://crab.idi.ntnu.no/index.php}}.
This report contains background information about swarming birds, and how 3 simple behaviors are applied to animated particles to make the flock like real birds found in nature.
Section \ref{sec:background} contains background information, it explains shortly what swarming is, how swarms can be used to simulate animals found in nature, more precise how to simulate bird flocking using the Boid algorithms developed by Cra.
