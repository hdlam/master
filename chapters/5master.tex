\section{Master project}
For my master project and thesis I will try to implement the Boids behavior on the ChIRP robots. For object avoidance I will use the IR-LEDs to find out if they robot is too close to an object it should have avoided and let it avoid it by turning away from it. Each robot will communicate with a computer using the bluetooth module. This computer will have an overview of the system using the USB web camera. Swarming robots are not supposed to communicate with an overall system, but due to the technical limitation and sensors each robot is equipped with a computer with a camera is needed to find the position and rotation of each robot. After simple Boid behavior is implemented, I will try to implement different type of steering behaviors mentioned in the steering paper.
