Research method

To be able to address the research questions, a simulator was created to run the Boids algorithm in simulation. The purpose of the simulator was to be able to see how each Boids are supposed to behave, and the code from the simulator could easily be ported to the real robots afterwards. The simulator also serves as a starting point for the real robots, for debugging purpose.

%TODO write something about how the robots were used.
