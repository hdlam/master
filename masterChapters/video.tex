\chapter{Video results}
It is hard to tell if the robots are behaving like they are supposed to by only looking at graphs and interpreting them.
Videos of a random run per scenario was created because of this.
All the videos were filmed using a mobile phone. The QR-code can be used to get access to the links without the need to type them out. All of the QR-code were generated using \href{http://goqr.me/}{http://goqr.me/}.
All of the videos were filmed from the other side of the room, and will therefore be mirrored and upside down compared to the images shown in \ref{sec:experimentalSetup}.

This video is not three minutes long, because someone was calling the phone, therefore the video got cut short.
