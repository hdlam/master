%TODO write intro to this chapter here
This section will look further upon what research question is still unanswered.

\textbf{More robots}
%TODO NOTES:
The current implementation of the system only supports four robot simultaneously, a new robot can not be added to the system without uploading the code to each robot in use. 
This is because the robot needs to know how many other robots there will be, because it will need to know how much data it is going to store before processing it. This has to be changed manually in the code and then uploaded to the robot again.
A working flocking flock should have more than four robots running simultaneously, and we should be able to add a new robot without re-uploading the code to the robots.

\textbf{More fluid movement}
The current implementation does not punish the robot for standing still nor for only rotating on the same spot. The only escape from continuously spinning around on the same spot is a counter, which forces the robot to move forward if it has been stuck on a spot for five iterations and if there is nothing in front of it. 
Make the movement of the robots more fluid

[From template] %TODO remove
Consider where you would like to extend this work. These extensions might either be continuing the ongoing direction or taking a side direction that became obvious during the work. Further, possible solutions to limitations in the work conducted, highlighted in ~\ref{sec:Discussion} may be presented.
