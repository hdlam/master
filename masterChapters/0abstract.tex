This thesis gives a brief overview to the field of swarm robotics, and investigates how robots are able to flock together using the Boids algorithm. Four robots will be used for the experiments. %Swarm robotics is an emergent field in


%This paper provides a template for writing AI project rapports for either the AI specialization project; masters "datateknikk" or masters "informatikk". The use of the template is recommended and is written in English as we encourage students to submit their project and masters theses in English. 
%The template does not form a compulsory style that you are obliged to use. However, the format and contents are a result of a joint AI group initiative thus providing a common starting point for all AI students. For a given project tuning of the template may still be required. Such tuning might involve moving a chapter to a section or vice versa due to the nature of the project.

%The abstract is your sales pitch which encourages people to read your work but unlike sales it should be realistic with respect to the contributions of the work. It should include:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item the field of research *
%\item a brief motivation for the work
%\item what the research topic is and
%\item the research approach(es) applied. 
%\item contributions
%\end{itemize}
%
%The abstract length should be roughly half a page of text --- without lists, tables or figures.

%The preface includes the facts - what type of project, where it is conducted, who supervised and any acknowledgements you wish to give. 

I would like to thank Christian Skjetne one of the creator of the ChIRP robot for helping with the technical difficulties that occurred when using the robots on both the bluetooth communication and the setup of the Arduino libraries. A lot of the library code that the robot's motor and sensors relies on are written by Christian.

%The camera tracking software was written by Erik Samuelson
